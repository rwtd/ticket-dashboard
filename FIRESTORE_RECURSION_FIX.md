# Firestore Infinite Recursion Fix

## Problem
When starting the application, it would hang with "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error and log "✅ Firestore database initialized" hundreds of times.

## Root Cause
**Circular dependency in logging:**

1. `start_ui.py` calls `setup_firestore_logging()` to enable Firestore logging
2. `FirestoreLogHandler` is added to the root logger
3. When `firestore_db.py` initializes, it logs: `logger.info("✅ Firestore database initialized")`
4. This triggers `FirestoreLogHandler.emit()`
5. Which accesses `self.db` property
6. Which calls `get_database()` from `firestore_db.py`
7. Which logs "✅ Firestore database initialized" again
8. **INFINITE LOOP!**

## Solution Applied

### Fix 1: Filter out firestore_db logs in emit()
```python
def emit(self, record: logging.LogRecord):
    # CRITICAL: Prevent infinite recursion by ignoring logs from firestore_db module
    if record.name == 'firestore_db' or record.module == 'firestore_db':
        return
    # ... rest of emit logic
```

### Fix 2: Disable logging during Firestore writes
```python
def _write_to_firestore(self, log_entry: dict):
    # Temporarily disable logging to prevent recursion
    old_level = logging.root.level
    logging.root.setLevel(logging.CRITICAL + 1)  # Disable all logging
    
    try:
        # Write to Firestore
        collection_ref = self.db.db.collection(self.collection_name)
        collection_ref.document(doc_id).set(log_entry)
    finally:
        # Restore logging level
        logging.root.setLevel(old_level)
```

## Files Modified
- `firestore_logger.py`:
  - Line 32-34: Added filter to ignore firestore_db logs
  - Line 74-88: Added logging suspension during Firestore writes

## Testing
After applying the fix:
```bash
python start_ui.py
```

Should now show:
```
🚀 Starting Ticket Dashboard UI...
==================================================
✅ All dependencies found
📁 Directory ready: tickets/
📁 Directory ready: uploads/
📁 Directory ready: results/
📝 Firestore logging enabled (7-day retention)

🌐 Starting web server...
📍 URL: http://localhost:5000
```

No more infinite "✅ Firestore database initialized" messages!

## ALTS Warning (Harmless)
You may still see this warning - it's harmless and can be ignored:
```
E0000 00:00:1760626140.942428  161622 alts_credentials.cc:93] 
ALTS creds ignored. Not running on GCP and untrusted ALTS is not enabled.
```

This is just Google's gRPC library noting that you're not running on GCP. It doesn't affect functionality.

## Impact
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ No more recursion errors
- ✅ Firestore logging works correctly
- ✅ Dashboard loads normally
- ✅ All features functional
