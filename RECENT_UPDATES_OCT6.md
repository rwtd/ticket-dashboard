# Recent Updates - October 6, 2025

## Summary
This session focused on improving data quality, UI enhancements, and error handling across the ticket dashboard platform.

---

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### 1. Manager Ticket Filtering
**Problem**: Manager tickets (Richie) were being included in support team analytics, skewing the metrics.

**Solution**:
- Added `_remove_manager_tickets()` method in `ticket_processor.py`
- Automatically filters to only include support team: `Bhushan`, `Girly`, `Francis`, `Nova`
- Removed 257 manager tickets from analytics dataset

**Impact**: Analytics now accurately reflect only support team performance (4,722 tickets vs previous 4,979)

---

### 2. Pipeline Name Mapping
**Problem**: Dashboard charts displayed numeric pipeline IDs (e.g., "724973238", "147307289") instead of readable names.

**Solution**:
- Added `fetch_pipelines()` method to `hubspot_fetcher.py` to retrieve ID→name mapping from HubSpot API
- Implemented `_map_pipeline_names()` in `ticket_processor.py` for existing data
- Updated `data_sync_service.py` to map during sync for new data

**Pipeline Mappings**:
- `0` → Support Pipeline
- `147307289` → Live Chat
- `648529801` → Upgrades/Downgrades
- `667370066` → Success
- `724973238` → Customer Onboarding
- `76337708` → Dev Tickets
- `77634704` → Marketing, Finance
- `803109779` → Product Testing Requests - Enterprise
- `803165721` → Trial Account Requests - Enterprise
- `95256452` → Enterprise and VIP Tickets
- `95947431` → SPAM Tickets

**Impact**: Dashboard charts now show readable pipeline names like "Customer Onboarding" instead of cryptic IDs.

### 3. Widget Garden
**What**: New embeddable widgets gallery for external platforms.

**Implementation**:
- New endpoint: `/widgets` with widget registry listing
- Added Widget Garden button to main dashboard header
- Gradient-styled button with responsive mobile layout
- Vertical stacking layout for better widget browsing
- Secure CSP headers for iframe embedding

**Features**:
- Browse available widgets
- Copy embed code
- Pre-configured for HubSpot and custom platforms
- Test widgets before deploying

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

#### Chat Date Processing
**Problem**: Chat data with "Unknown" dates caused parsing errors: `time data 'Unknown' doesn't match format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`

**Solution**: Added `errors='coerce'` to `pd.to_datetime()` calls in `chat_processor.py`

**Impact**: 1,826 rows with "Unknown" dates now gracefully convert to NaT instead of crashing.

#### Admin Panel NaT Comparison
**Problem**: Admin data status threw error: `'<=' not supported between instances of 'Timestamp' and 'float'`

**Solution**: Added `.dropna()` filter in `admin_routes.py` before calculating date ranges

**Impact**: Admin panel now correctly displays chat date ranges without errors.

#### Warning Suppression
**Problem**: Annoying pandas FutureWarning messages cluttering logs.

**Solution**: Added warning filters to key entry points:
- `app.py`
- `data_sync_service.py`
- `google_sheets_data_source.py`

**Impact**: Clean logs without unnecessary warning spam.

### 5. UI/UX Improvements

#### Header Layout
- Added Widget Garden button with gradient purple styling (`#f093fb` to `#f5576c`)
- Increased header padding-right to 500px for three buttons
- Fixed mobile responsive layout to stack buttons vertically
- Improved button spacing and hover effects

#### Widget Registry
- Changed from grid layout to vertical stack (`flex-direction: column`)
- Increased gap from 10px to 20px
- Increased card padding from 12px to 20px
- Added max-width: 1200px for better readability
- Widgets now have "room to breathe"

### 6. Data Quality Improvements

#### Chat Data Sync
**Problem**: Chat dates were showing as NaT in Google Sheets.

**Root Cause**:
1. Chat processor designed for CSV exports, not API data
2. Datetime values not preserved during Google Sheets upload

**Solution**:
1. Bypassed chat processor for API-synced data in `data_sync_service.py`
2. Fixed datetime→ISO string conversion in `google_sheets_exporter.py`
3. Cleared and re-uploaded chat data from CSV (2,586 chats)

**Impact**: Chat analytics now work correctly with proper date filtering.
