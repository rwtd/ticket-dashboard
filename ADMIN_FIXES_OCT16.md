# Admin Interface Fixes - October 16, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Google Sheets Configuration Display Issue
**Problem:** Admin dashboard showed "Google Sheets: Not Configured" even though the spreadsheet ID was set in `.env`

**Root Cause:** Backend was sending `config.firestore_configured` but template expected `config.sheets_configured`

**Fix:** Updated `admin_routes.py` line 66 to send `sheets_configured` based on `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID` environment variable

### 2. Data Status Loading Error
**Problem:** JavaScript error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'tickets')"

**Root Cause:** The `/admin/data-status` endpoint returned data structure with `firestore` and `local` keys, but the template JavaScript was trying to access `data.sheets.tickets`

**Fix:** Updated `templates/admin/dashboard.html` line 567 to read from `data.firestore.tickets` instead of `data.sheets.tickets`

### 3. Log Stream Not Working
**Problem:** Live log console showed connection errors and duplicate GET requests in CLI logs

**Root Cause:** The `/admin/logs/stream` endpoint didn't exist in the backend

**Fix:** 
- Added `/admin/logs/stream` endpoint in `admin_routes.py` (line 556)
- Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming with heartbeats
- Added `/admin/test-logs` endpoint for testing
- Fixed import to use `Response` from Flask instead of non-existent `app.response_class`

## Files Modified

### `admin_routes.py`
1. **Line 8:** Added `Response` to Flask imports
2. **Line 66:** Added `sheets_configured` for template compatibility
3. **Line 69-70:** Added `sync_interval` and `retention_days` to config
4. **Line 74:** Changed to load sync state instead of firestore status
5. **Line 556-603:** Added log streaming endpoints (`/logs/stream` and `/test-logs`)
6. **Line 615-629:** Added `_load_sync_state()` helper function

### `templates/admin/dashboard.html`
1. **Line 192-213:** Simplified "Data Source Management" card - removed CSV upload UI
2. **Line 250:** Updated description: "APIs to Firestore" instead of "APIs to Google Sheets"
3. **Line 567-587:** Updated JavaScript to read from `data.firestore` instead of `data.sheets`
4. **Line 629-650:** Removed unused `updateDataSourceSelection()` function
5. **Line 783-791:** Removed localStorage data source restoration code

## Architecture Changes

The admin interface now correctly reflects the new Firestore-first architecture:

**Old Flow (Google Sheets as Database):**
```
APIs → Google Sheets ← Dashboard reads here
```

**New Flow (Firestore as Database):**
```
APIs → Firestore ← Dashboard reads here
       ↓
   Google Sheets (export for stakeholders)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Admin dashboard loads without JavaScript errors
- [x] Google Sheets configuration badge shows correct status
- [x] Data status shows Firestore counts correctly
- [x] Log streaming connects without errors
- [ ] Test connections button works (requires API credentials)
- [ ] Full sync button works (requires API credentials)
- [ ] Incremental sync button works (requires API credentials)

## Next Steps

1. Test the dashboard locally with proper Google Cloud authentication
2. Verify Firestore connection and data display
3. Test sync operations with actual API credentials
4. Update widgets to use Firestore
5. Deploy to Cloud Run

## Notes

- Log streaming currently only sends heartbeats - full log capture would require a custom logging handler
- CSV upload functionality was removed as it's no longer the primary data source
- Local CSV files are now considered backups only, not primary data sources
